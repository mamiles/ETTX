SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

1.  Solaris 2.8 is required for running ETTX Admin Application.
    
2.  Solaris 8 should also be installed with all the necessary patches to support 
    the Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE) SDK version 1.4.0.  To review the patch 
    requirements for JDK1.4.0 please go to the following URL:

    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/install-solaris-patches.html

    It is also recommended that the latest Patch Cluster for Solaris 8 be installed.  
    You can download the latest patch cluster at the following URL:

    http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/show.pl?target=patches/patch-access


BUILDING THE SOFTWARE

1.  Java 1.4.1_01 must be setup in your environment and path.  Make sure the following
    is setup in your environment:

	export JAVA_HOME=/auto/austin-nms/ettx/3rdparty/java/j2sdk1.4.1_01
	export $JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

2.  Ant 1.5.1 must also be setup in your path to build ETTX Admin App.  The following 
    must be setup in your environment:

	export ANT_HOME=/auto/austin-nms/ettx/jakarta-ant/jakarta-ant-1.5.1
	export PATH=$ANT_HOME/bin:$PATH

3.  The Clear Case for ETTX Admin App is using RAW Clear Case without any customized 
    triggers or Cisco tools.  The vob cluster being used is nsm-vob1 which is located 
    in San Jose.  You can access the vob by /vob/sms-admin

    Command to setup view for building the application:

	mkview -tag <userid>-sms-admin -host nsm-view1 \
			-hpath /vws/bpo/<userid>-sms-admin \
			-gpath /vws/bpo/<userid>-sms-admin \
			/vws/bpo/<userid>-sms-admin

4.  Setup the view you just created

	cleartool setview <userid>-sms-admin

5.  Change to the root directory in the vob.

	cd /vob/sms-admin

6.  Using ANT you can build the complete package.  Make sure you setup Java and Ant 
    in your path as defined above.  The command "ant all " will build all targets:

	ant all


INSTALLATION

   You have the ability to install ETTX from the VOB or create a TAR file of the installation
that could be installed on any machine.


INSTALLATION DIRECTLY FROM THE VOB

1.  Change to the following directory:

	cd /vob/sms-admin/install

2.  Determine the installation directory.  If the directory does not exist you may want to 
    create the directory manually if the user id you will be using to install does not have
    write permissions to create the directory.  It does not mater if you use "root" or any other
    user id but it is recommended that the same user id used to install the ETTX Admin App is 
    also the same user id that runs the server.

3.  Run the following script and specify the installation directory.  Make sure you have 
    permissions to write the directory.  Also if you previously have install to that 
    directory make sure you have brought down the server and it is OK to delete all the 
    previous install files.

	ettx_install.sh <install directory>

    During the install you will be ask the following questions:
    	
    	a) Admin App installation directory
    	b) SPE Admin User ID
    	c) SPE Admin Password
    	d) Default UNIX Host prompt
    	e) Admin Web Server Port
    	f) SMC Hostname
    	g) SMC port
    	h) SPE Hostname
    	i) SPE port


CREATING A COMPRESSED TAR TO BE INSTALLED ON ANY SOLARIS WORKSTATION

1.  Change to the following directory:

	cd /vob/sms-admin/install

2.  Determine the installation directory.  If the directory does not exist you may want to 
    create the directory manually if the user id you will be using to install does not have
    write permissions to create the directory.  It does not mater if you use "root" or any other
    user id but it is recommended that the same user id used to install the ETTX Admin App is 
    also the same user id that runs the server.
    
3.  Run the following script to create the tar file.  You can specify the location to put
    the tar file on the command line or the script will prompt where to put the file.
    
    	create_install_tar.sh <target directory>
    	
    The script will create "ettx_admin_install_YYYMMDD.tar.Z" in the target directory.
    
4.  To install ETTX, copy the ettx_admin_install_YYYMMDD.tar.Z to the machine of choice and
    location of choice.

5.  Uncompress and un tar the file

	uncompress < ettx_admin_install_YYYMMDD.tar.Z | tar -xf -
	
6.  Change to the sub directory created "ettx_admin_install_YYYMMDD".

	cd ettx_admin_install_YYYMMDD

7.  Run the following script and specify the installation directory.  Make sure you have 
    permissions to write the directory.  Also if you previously have install to that 
    directory make sure you have brought down the server and it is ok to delete all the 
    previous install files.

	ettx_install.sh <install directory>

    During the install you will be ask the following questions:
    
    	a) Admin App installation directory
    	b) SPE Admin User ID
    	c) SPE Admin Password
    	d) Default UNIX Host prompt
    	e) Admin Web Server Port
    	f) SMC Hostname
    	g) SMC port
    	h) SPE Hostname
    	i) SPE port

RUNNING THE PROGRAM

1.  It is highly recommended that server be started with the same user id as was used to 
    install the software.

2.  Change to the target installation directory.

	For example (/opt/ettx)
	
	cd /opt/ettx

3.  Run the ettx script to start the server.

	ettx start
	
	ettx stop
	
	ettx status
